# dotfiles

Personal workflow and preference files for a new server/laptop: bash + zsh, Neovim, tmux, scripts, cron helpers, and a small Pi-only AI scaffold. Works on Linux (bash) and macOS (zsh); both shells share one aliases file.

The core dotfiles are installed with GNU Stow. Scripts and AI files are kept in the repo but are not stowed into `$HOME` by default. Git config is intentionally **not** managed here — identity and auth (credential helpers, signing keys) vary per machine, so set those up per host.

## Quick installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jishnujp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

One-liner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jishnujp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

## What `install.sh` does

- Ensures GNU Stow is installed, or prompts to install it.
- Stows only these packages by default:
  - `bash` → `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, `~/.inputrc`, `~/.bashrc.local.example`
  - `zsh` → `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshrc.local.example` (macOS default shell)
  - `shell` → `~/.shell_common.sh` (shared aliases/env sourced by bash **and** zsh)
  - `nvim` → `~/.config/nvim`
  - `tmux` → `~/.tmux.conf`
- Does **not** stow `scripts/`, `ai/`, `assets/`, or `docs/`.
- Does **not** manage git config; set `~/.gitconfig` up per machine.
- The managed `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` add `~/dotfiles/scripts/bin` to `PATH` and source `~/.bashrc.local` / `~/.zshrc.local` when present.
- Prompts interactively when existing target files conflict:
  - back up existing targets and continue
  - skip that package
  - abort
- Prints a secret-hygiene reminder before you commit anything.

## Scripts

After installation and reloading your shell, commands in `scripts/bin/` are available on `PATH`.

Current commands include:

- `backup <folder>` — create timestamped tar.gz backups in `~/backup/`
- `practice <project-name>` — create a Python practice environment
- `closeall` — close open windows, requires `wmctrl` (Linux/X11)
- `simple-server` — start a tiny local HTTP response on port `1500`
- `pi-workflow-init` — helper for Pi workflow setup

The scripts in `scripts/bin/` and `scripts/cron/` are Linux-oriented (they assume `wmctrl`, GNOME `gsettings`, `sha1sum`, and `/home/<user>` paths) and have not been made macOS-portable. Cron helpers live in `scripts/cron/`, are not installed automatically — review/edit paths before adding them to your crontab.

## Shell local config

Machine-specific shell settings belong in a host-local file that is sourced by the managed shell config and must not be committed:

```bash
cp ~/.bashrc.local.example ~/.bashrc.local   # bash / Linux
cp ~/.zshrc.local.example  ~/.zshrc.local    # zsh / macOS
```

Aliases and env that should apply on **both** shells go in `shell/.shell_common.sh` (stowed to `~/.shell_common.sh`), which `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` both source.

## Manual Stow usage

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow bash       # or: stow zsh   (macOS)
stow shell
stow nvim
stow tmux
stow -D nvim   # unstow
stow -R nvim   # restow
```

Do not run `stow */`; that would try to stow non-dotfile directories such as `scripts/`, `ai/`, `assets/`, and `docs/`.

## Dependencies

Required:

- git
- bash (Linux) or zsh (macOS)
- GNU Stow

Optional, depending on what you use:

- neovim
- jq, curl
- wmctrl (Linux/X11, for `closeall`)
- gsettings/GNOME tools (Linux, for cron wallpaper helpers)
- a clipboard tool for tmux: `xclip` (X11), `wl-clipboard` (Wayland), or `pbcopy` (built into macOS)

Ubuntu example:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git stow neovim jq curl wmctrl xclip
```

macOS example:

```bash
brew install stow neovim jq   # zsh is the default shell; pbcopy is built in
```

## Secret hygiene

Do not commit credentials, OAuth tokens, PATs, local shell settings, `.env` files, or machine-local agent settings.

Before committing, run:

```bash
git status --short --ignored
git ls-files | grep -Ei '(^|/)(\.env|.*\.local|settings\.local\.json|credentials|token.*\.json)$' || true
```

Important: adding a pattern to `.gitignore` does **not** untrack a file that is already tracked. If a secret-like file is tracked, remove it from git without deleting your local copy:

```bash
git rm --cached <file>
```

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
git pull
./install.sh
```
